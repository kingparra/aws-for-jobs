Definitions
-----------
Scalability

  The ability of a system to perform more or less work by
  adding or removing resources.

Elasticity

  A strategy for scaling where resources are added when demand
  increases and removed when demand decreases, automatically.


Prose
-----
This module covers four services: EC2 Auto Scaling, AWS Auto Scaling, Elastic
Load Balancing and Simple Notification Service.
