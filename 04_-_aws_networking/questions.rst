Can I delete the default router in a custom VPC (assigned to ``*.1``)?

How do I create a point-to-point connection between two instances,
as though I've connected the primary Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
of each instance to the other with a cross-over cable?

What is a NAT instance?

Do people sometimes make small special-purpose instances for networking
instead of using the built-in AWS resources?

What are all the ways I create a VPC using best practices as a one-liner? (Terraform modules, level 2/3 constructs in CDK, the equivalent in Pulumi, etc.)

What are the options for mesh networking?

What about network stacks other than TCP/IP?
